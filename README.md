# Super-Store-Dashboard

Tableau Superstore Dashboard Project for Tableau Superstore Dataset

In this project, we analyzed the Tableau Superstore dataset, which is a sample dataset provided by Tableau for new users to learn and experiment with different functionalities available in Tableau. The dataset contains information about products, sales, profits, and other relevant metrics. Let's dive into the key points:

1. Year-over-Year Profit and Sales Analysis:
   - We calculated year-over-year profit and sales trends to understand how the company's performance has evolved over time.
   - By identifying patterns in profit and sales growth, we can make informed decisions about resource allocation and strategic planning.

2. Distribution of Average Profit by Location:
   - We studied the average profit across different locations to identify high-performing regions.
   - This information helps us allocate resources effectively and focus on regions with strong profit margins.

3. Top and Bottom Customers Based on Sales:
   - We analyzed customer data to identify top-performing customers (those contributing significantly to sales) and low-performing customers.
   - Understanding customer behavior allows us to tailor marketing efforts and improve customer satisfaction.

4. Returns After Shipping Over Time:
   - We examined return rates over time to identify any trends or anomalies.
   - By addressing return-related issues promptly, we can enhance customer experience and reduce costs.



By analyzing these patterns, we can derive actionable insights:

1. Profit Categories and Subcategories:
   - Categorize products based on their profitability (e.g., high-profit vs. low-profit categories).
   - Allocate resources strategically to boost profitability in specific product segments.

2. Attention to Non-Profit Categories:
   - Focus on non-profitable product categories and subcategories.
   - Explore ways to improve margins or consider discontinuing unprofitable products.

3. Sales Planning for Regions:
   - Plan sales strategies for regions with strong sales performance.
   - Optimize marketing efforts based on regional demand.

4. Addressing Low-Sales Regions:
   - Identify regions with low sales.
   - Implement targeted promotions or programs to boost sales in these areas.

5. Returns Management:
   - Pay attention to return-related categories and subcategories.
   - Implement measures to reduce returns and enhance customer satisfaction.

Remember that this analysis is based on the fictitious Tableau Superstore dataset, but the principles apply broadly to real-world scenarios as well.
